Yet it is so relevant to me, to us right now. I don’t have much idea about what VCs would do to you because I only met one and only one person from a VC in person. And I wasn’t too impressed on what he was trying to tell us; I didn’t see anything relevant to the state of our company at the point when I heard him talking. He was too loud to be ignored either.\n\nI don’t know if it would be better not to get a VC on board, but I know that without their money we are not where where we are today because we would have run out of money. But then again, does it have to be that way, that we hire this many people, have a decent office, run this many servers and pay this money to some  web services that can be replaced with a few OSS stack.\n\n","navs":{"nextPage":{"epoch":"1391979240","title":"Moved to T-Mobile","slug":"/blog/moved-to-t-mobile"},"prevPage":{"epoch":"1391634060","title":"David Heinemeier Hansson at Startup School 2008","slug":"/blog/david-heinemeier-hansson-at-startup-school-2008"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
