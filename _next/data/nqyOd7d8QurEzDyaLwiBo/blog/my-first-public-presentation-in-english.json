You can watch it here until it would be taken down (I’ll appear at around 31:10).\n\n[http://mlb.mlb.com/media/player/entry.jsp?calendar\\_event\\_id=14-403620-2014-03-04&source=NYTM](http://mlb.mlb.com/media/player/entry.jsp?calendar_event_id=14-403620-2014-03-04&source=NYTM)\n\nIt was supposed to be a 3 minutes lightning talk. 3 minutes! I have never done anything that short. It was also an introduction to our product, for which people in the company has different opinion about what to talk. But in the end I ignored most of the suggestions because of two reasons; it wouldn’t be anything closer to good if I didn’t speak what I thought I’d talk in 3 minutes in my second language. And I was also pretty confident of myself being able to give a good talk. After all, I used to be a professional conference speaker for more than five years. No colleagues in the office saw my speaking, so it was understandable that they were worried about me. But it was what I was very good at doing. Now they must know. I see very positive tweets which makes me proud.  \nThe question now is, should I seek more opportunities to talk about something in public? I found that it was surprisingly comfortable giving the talk last night. Maybe I should. But then the next question is if I have something to talk about which could be interesting to audiences. That, I must answer myself.\n\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
