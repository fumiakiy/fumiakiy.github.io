It shows what are relevant to you regardless of what type of objects they are. Very much like Google Now, which shows many different types of “cards” in one list.\n\nIn the list, I want to show as many “stuff” as possible in a small screen of a phone. The app could list things like tickets you have got, list of events the app recommends to you, tweets and FB posts related to an event you are going, etc etc. Lining up all of these items vertically in a scrolling view is an okay-idea; but it’s pretty obvious that the latter an item is listed, the latter it’s going to be actually seen (or to impress the user). As of this writing, Facebook and Twitter both put relevant items in vertically scrolling list, while some items (mostly Ads, some photos if there are many) occupies only a height of an item while showing many child items in horizontally scrolling list. I would have liked that in my app too.\n\nYou can see the guts of what I implemented in [one of my GitHub repositories](https://github.com/fumiakiy/HorizontalScrollSample). Here in [this commit I implemented very basic vertically scrolling list](https://github.com/fumiakiy/HorizontalScrollSample/commit/45af3bd8cbcad3fea1cf5ac256f6a07359a2a9cc) by using RecyclerView and its friends. Then I [added “ItemClick” event handler](https://github.com/fumiakiy/HorizontalScrollSample/commit/f8ff3871aa9ffa0684faf50c7febc4bcf08f6c4c) in the next commit. Simple, so far.\n\nNow I want to modify some of those items have its own child items that are horizontally scrolling. I added another layout XML that has a RecyclerView. So, the root RecyclerView has list of CardViews. Each CardView renders either [a text](https://github.com/fumiakiy/HorizontalScrollSample/blob/master/app/src/main/res/layout/list_item_text.xml) or [another RecyclerView](https://github.com/fumiakiy/HorizontalScrollSample/blob/master/app/src/main/res/layout/list_item_horizontal_parent.xml). Basically, many RecyclerViews are nested inside a RecyclerView. Each child RecyclerView has as many items its adapter gives it, and [renders each item using (happens to be) the same layout as is used in the parent RecyclerView to render a simple text](https://github.com/fumiakiy/HorizontalScrollSample/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/luckypines/horizontalscrollsample/HorizontalItemsViewHolder.java#L22). So far so good.\n\nThe last but the hardest part to implement in a way that makes sense to me is to handle “ItemClick” event fired by each child items in a horizontally scrolling item. The very first idea that comes to my mind is to define OnItemClickListener in the [ViewHolder](https://github.com/fumiakiy/HorizontalScrollSample/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/luckypines/horizontalscrollsample/HorizontalItemsViewHolder.java). If you think about it, each of the parent items in the vertically scrolling list fires the event to the handler that MainActivity defines; the same structure should work, so it’s natural for each ViewHolder to define OnItemClickListener for each of its own children.\n\nBut I dumped the idea because it didn’t make sense to me. ViewHolder should be a reusable utility class for a type of View/Layout rendered in a RecyclerView. It must not be tied to a particular item. But in order to implement OnItemClickListener, an instance of ViewHolder must know about either the list of items that its parent RecyclerView is rendering, or each item that is rendered. The latter makes the ViewHolder un-reusable. The former idea, well, having a reference in something that could be discarded at any point (RecyclerView aggressively recycles views) make hard the fighting NullPointerException.\n\nThese are what I have thought through, to conclude [my implementation of having both ItemClickListener (children and grandchildren)](https://github.com/fumiakiy/HorizontalScrollSample/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/luckypines/horizontalscrollsample/MainActivity.java#L96-L114) in MainActivity.\n\nIt first detects if if’s a “touch-up” event. It then finds an item that must be under where the touch event occurs. If an item is a type of String, it fires the direct child’s OnItemClick (well, virtually said. It does what the event handler does inline in the example). If an item is not a type of String, it must be an array of String in this case, which means the item is a horizontally scrolling CardView. It [calculates offset to the CardView](https://github.com/fumiakiy/HorizontalScrollSample/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/luckypines/horizontalscrollsample/MainActivity.java#L105) and [pass the calculated coordinates to the ViewHolder’s method to get a grand child item](https://github.com/fumiakiy/HorizontalScrollSample/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/luckypines/horizontalscrollsample/HorizontalItemsViewHolder.java#L25). If the position of a grand child item is found, it looks for the grand child and fires OnChildItemClick (again, it writes [what it does in line](https://github.com/fumiakiy/HorizontalScrollSample/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/luckypines/horizontalscrollsample/MainActivity.java#L108-L109)). Woot. Mission accomplished.\n\nI am not saying that this is the best way to handle these stuff though. I have a part of myself who doesn’t like this complicated implementation. Implementing ViewHolder pattern correctly is hard.\n\nPlease let me know what I am doing wrong if you see it. Thanks for reading thus far.\n\n"},{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/butter-knife-vs-android-annotations","date":"Sat, 25 Apr 2015 23:04:24 GMT","title":"Butter Knife vs Android Annotations","epoch":"1430003064"},"markdownBody":"        \nThere was a tech conference geared towards Android app developers, #DroidKaigi in Japan. I wasn’t able to attend unfortunately because it happened in Tokyo while I was in New York, but thanks to the folks who share most everything to the Internet, I could feel how it went. It sounds it went really well. Congratulations to the event organizers.\n\nOne thing that got me when I was reading those blogs and summaries about the conference was that [Butter Knife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) sounded more popular and better loved by them than [Android Annotations](http://androidannotations.org/). I just sent a new Android app to our quality assurance process. The app was completely written from scratch by myself, which uses Android Annotations everywhere and I was a little concerned that I might have chosen the wrong library (again…?).\n\nBut it turned out that I wasn’t that much wrong. Butter Knife solves a problem that Android Annotations also solves, but it doesn’t have a critical part (for me) that Android Annotations helped me a lot while working on my app; Extra, FragmentArg and InstanceState.\n\nWithout these annotations, I have had to write \\_very correct\\_ code to handle saveInstanceState and onCreate and everything else. Now it might sound trivial - you just have to pass objects to an Activity you are starting and the code to handle them is well pattern-ed by now - but when it comes to handling orientation changes it gets incredibly hard to write “the correct” code. Fortunately, Android Annotations does the right thing for you with this tiny cost of you have to be careful that you are going to start Activity\\_ (with the trailing underscore), not the Activity you write (AndroidManifest.xml).\n\nTo be honest, we did have problems with Android Annotations in developing the previous versions of our app, especially with EFragment and AfterViews injections, but it turned out it was our fault - mostly because we wrote code that does “view initialization” in AfterViews methods, which turned out to be called every time the view is created. In Android, orientation changes destroy views and they are recreated. With some of those “gotchas” in mind, Android Annotations served really well for me this time.\n\nTo make it a little clear, I didn’t write code that use Butter Knife. I didn’t use EBean, EService, Rest or any other fancy attributes that Android Annotations offer either. EActivity, EFragment, ViewById, Click, OptionsMenu, OptionsItem, Extra, FragmentArg, and InstanceState are the ones I used and loved. I might try to use some more in the upcoming versions, but those only still make significant difference. I understand when someone say Android Annotations is simple overkill; it did concern me when I think of those unused features that Android Annotations offer, but hey, I managed to keep away from [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) and the app still compiles without [multidex](https://developer.android.com/tools/building/multidex.html) enabled.\n\nI will write more about what I learned when I was writing the Android app soon.\n\n"},{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/this-is-so-awesome-i-cant-help-but-posting-it","date":"Wed, 04 Mar 2015 16:34:15 GMT","title":"This is so awesome I can’t help but posting it here.\nFrom [http://www.mobileattack.com/android/another-wallpaper-apple-sliced-by-android-jedi/](http://www.mobileattack.com/android/another-wallpaper-apple-sliced-by-android-jedi/)","epoch":"1425486855"},"markdownBody":"        \n\n\nhttps://64.media.tumblr.com/5e003a545527fe2f1e5349f6630cf612/tumblr\\_nkp4p3HvW21qz65w3o1\\_1280.jpg"},{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/unit-testing-android-app-using-robolectric-and","date":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 20:16:00 GMT","title":"Unit testing Android app using Robolectric and Android Studio 1.0.1","epoch":"1418760960"},"markdownBody":"        \nI have been reluctant to write tests for my Android projects because…\n\n1.  I didn’t really know what to test. TextView.is.visible.and.hasText(“Hello World”). Er, um.\n2.  I did write some tests as experiments. It runs and start activities in my device. If I didn’t connect my device to my mac, it runs in the emulator. It is slow and it does destruct my focus on writing code.\n\n[At one of the greatest meetup experience of any kind that was held at Spotify NYC office by NY Android developers meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/android-developers-nyc/events/219023775/), I learned less painful ways of doing unit tests for Android dev. [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/). It allows an Android project to run inside JUnit/IDE. Woot! I have got to try that.\n\nI thought that Robolectric was mostly a drop-in replacement of a standard Android testing framework that is installed when you create a new project in Android Studio. I was wrong. It took 8 hours worth of my spare time to get it finally working with \\`gradlew test\\` inside the Terminal window of Android Studio 1.0.1. It took another 4 hours to figure out running on JUnit test runner inside Android Studio 1.0.1 IDE.\n\nInstead of writing in a human readable language on how I made it work, I compiled my journey into a stream of commits in my GitHub repository. It should address many if not most of the issues you would be facing if you start doing the same stuff by yourself. I saw a lot of StackOverflow questions about it. Some of them are still applicable to Android Studio 1.0, but many of them were stale (don’t get me wrong. They were really helpful for me to figuring out where to look at. I appreciate it. That is why I list most of them in this writing later).\n\n[GitHub repository “AndroidAppWithRobolectricUnitTestsInAS101” by fumiakiy](https://github.com/fumiakiy/AndroidAppWithRobolectricUnitTestsInAS101)\n\nSo, try it by yourself (may be with some help from [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/fumiakiy/AndroidAppWithRobolectricUnitTestsInAS101)) and enjoy writing unit tests with [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/) inside Android Studio 1.0.1!\n\nHere is the list of most helpful links that I found during my journey of making it all work.\n\n*   [https://github.com/robolectric/deckard-gradle](https://github.com/robolectric/deckard-gradle)\n    \n    This is the default “installation” suggested by Robolectric. It works. The contents of build.gradle are what I copied to the first half of my “MyApplication” project. But simply importing all gradle settings fails MyApplication because Robolectric currently supports API level 18 and the project Android Studio 1.0.1 creates targets 21.\n    \n*   [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23867341/android-robolectric-does-not-support-api-level-1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23867341/android-robolectric-does-not-support-api-level-1)\n    \n    This SO is where I found a solution to API level issue. This one also reminded me that there are more than a few configuration you can specify in @Config annotation.\n    \n*   [https://github.com/square/assertj-android/issues/129#issuecomment-62205520](https://github.com/square/assertj-android/issues/129#issuecomment-62205520)\n    \n    After I added [AssertJ Android](http://square.github.io/assertj-android/) (that I also learned at the meetup), I started to see a build error again. This “temporary” solution is still required as of this writing to solve the issue.\n    \n*   [https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/issues/1018](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/issues/1018)\n    \n    ResourceNotFoundException wasn’t there for the first time I started this “project”, but it was because I changed MainActivity extends from Activity. The default was ActionBarActivity that Android Studio 1.0.1 generates, which raises the ResourceNotFoundException. This thread helped me find “qualifiers” attribute. But the suggested value “v10” didn’t work because I was using suport library 21.0.3 which has “v11”.\n    \n*   [http://blog.blundell-apps.com/android-gradle-app-with-robolectric-junit-tests/](http://blog.blundell-apps.com/android-gradle-app-with-robolectric-junit-tests/) and [http://blog.blundell-apps.com/how-to-run-robolectric-junit-tests-in-android-studio/](http://blog.blundell-apps.com/how-to-run-robolectric-junit-tests-in-android-studio/)\n    \n    After I was satisified with running tests by \\`gradlew test\\`, I added JUnit configuration to the project so the tests can run inside IDE with some nice visual and debuggability. It failed in many ways. These tutorials by Blundell helped me a lot to figure out how to run it in the IDE. The document was not for Android Studio 1.0.1 and some information may be stale and not applicable by now (for example, I didn’t have to specify Alt JRE, and I didn’t have to create a “testClasses” gradle configuration), but I wasn’t able to figure out to do it by creating a Java library outside of the app project and refer to the app project from it, without these tutorials.\n    \n*   [https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/issues/1334](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/issues/1334)\n    \n    I wasn’t able to “reproduce” this particular error when I was compiling my findings one step at a time, but I am sure I was hit by the error. This thread was where I found project.properties can specify libraries to look at. But later I found that you can also put library path to @Config attribute, which was handier for this project.\n    \n\nThanks to all of you who keeps records of what works and what doesn’t work.

It sounded nothing new to me, but it’s among the latest buzzwords.\n\nInter process communication\n---------------------------\n\nI started my carrier as an instructor/conference speaker at around 1995. Windows NT 3.51 finally made threads available to COM based applications through it’s intrduction of MTA (multi-threaded apartment). COM or Component Object Model was a technology that enabled inter-application communication through OLE2 (Object Linking and Embeddding). OLE(1) enabled an Excel speadsheet be embedded in an Word document. OLE2 made a step further and made the underlying technology available to 3rd party developers through COM. In other words, it was unix pipe for a Windows GUI application. Inter-process communication took place on top of COM’s intra-process, inter-thread communication.\n\nInter-machine communication\n---------------------------\n\nWith Windows NT 4 in 1996, Microsoft took a step even further and introduced DCOM, or Distributed COM. By 1996 with help by popularity of Windows 95, corporate intra-network became pretty popular. Client-Server system. Visual Basic application connected to Oracle 6 database. 3-tier, Windows DNA. Inter-machine communication took place. DCOM tried to solve the problem around programs communicates over machine boundary by leveraging COM inter-process communication.\n\nIt allowed programmers feel as if they were writing code that communicated with other COM interfaces over process boundary, even when they were writing code that actually communicated over machine boundary, over corporate, 100Base-T LAN.\n\nDCOM even introduced DCOM over HTTP later so COM interfaces can be exposed over the Internet.\n\nJ2EE/EJB, CORBA, the same story, different companies involved.\n\nSOAP\n----\n\nSOAP, or Simple Object Access Protocol, was born to make inter-machine communication over HTTP a reality. RPC can be replaced with HTTP protocol. Network data representation (NDR) can be replaced with an XML document. But SOAP is still a protocol for Object-RPC systems. It had been so until SOAP version 1.2. It was a tragedy for SOAP that SOAP v1.1 became too popular. Most dummy implementations of it naively believe RPC calls should look the same to programmers regardless of how long “the wire” was. SOAP 1.2 is a messaging protocol. It specifies a message format in XML Infoset which aimed to create an abstraction layer on top of XML document which is defined as text.\n\nSOAP 1.2 defines headers and bodies and processing models; it looks very much like what HTTP is being used today. SOAP 1.2 was intended to use more transfer protocols than just HTTP because HTTP was text based and thought to be slow; SOAP over SMTP could also be possible; SOAP could also be used even in-process communication (XML Infoset can be serialized to a binary format). It was too late; when Microsoft introduced .NET Framework, even most product managers in Microsoft still saw SOAP to see objects, at the time .NET objects written in C#. WSDL does have a way to define document oriented interface as well as legacy, rpc oriented interface. Document oriented interface never became popular. “Wise” brains started to criticize how stupid the idea was to event think about doing RPC over the wire. Coarse-grained messages. Messages, not method calls. Services not objects. Service oriented architecture.\n\nSOA\n---\n\nIt was interesting few months of my carrier during these days, because I was also able to see that there was the other side of the world. Blue pill? Red pill?\n\nIn the other side of thew world, Movable Type made trackback familiar. Dave Winer advocates RSS 0.91 and 2.0. RSS reader applications. NOKIA lifeblog protocol that can post an entry to TypePad from your cellphone.\n\nThese are based on this simple notion - sending an XML document over HTTP (be it GET or POST), is very usable for inter-process communication, without a concrete specification on which all tech giants agree. View source. Blog hacks. (I feel funny that Fiddler the sniffer became very popular these days. It was during these days I first used Fiddler and loved it until I switched to Mac.)\n\nAnd Google Maps. Ajax is not very much a “protocol” but more like a good old client-server communication. Its JavaScript calls fine grained methods. Google servers are fast enough to process that many number of method calls fast.\n\nThere was this buzzword - SOA during the timeframe around my carrier. In SOA, all participating endpoints agree not only on a protocol and a processing model, but they also agree on a very concrete “business process document schema”, at least in their ideal world. RosettaNet, BPEL, BizTalk.\n\nOn the other side though, Ajax exploded. RPC between JavaScript on a browser and an HTTP endpoint got popular among programmers once again. It does feel easier to architect coarse grained message with these important idea of “connections can be lost; messages can be half-broken, etc, etc”. All you do is call a simple method like “add(1, 2)” and get “3” as a result. Programmers love it. RPC is easier than Messaging.\n\nIt was SOA and this idea of “all parties agree on an XML schema” that finished me in that part of the world. It was a ridiculous idea to me given trackbacks and RSS were already working in practice out there.\n\nI joined Amazon as a technical evangelist, to adovoate to programmers. that this part of the world was more fun. I wrote magazine articles about it. I talked about it at some tech conferences. I let other programmers know how fun it would be to write code that does internetwork communication through “API” until I realized it would be fun for me too. I stopped talking and started writing code at Six Apart.\n\nWell now what?\n--------------\n\nFast forward a few years, I am still writing code that is getting large codebase. Some parts in my code communicate inside the system itself, but over HTTP. I heard the word microservices. Where limited number of coarse grained messages are transferred between services in a system. Wait, is this deja vu?\n\nNo, I guess not, partly because it is still about a monolithic system (if you can call “Amazon.com” a monolithic system). It is not about Amazon.com communicates with Google.com (which was what SOA circa 2005 was trying to accomplish). Also everybody in this generation understands that calling an endpoint over HTTP is way more expensive than calling a method inside a process. C10K problems.\n\nWell defined interface, but the parties who must agree on that interfaces are still within a firewall. History doesn’t just repeat; it iterates like it draws a spiral.\n\nI do feel sad when this generation points fingers at and laughs at SOAP/WSDL though. It surely served my carrier. I even feel grateful to Microsoft to adapt to SOAP, for if it were not them, I wasn’t aware of those XML related stuff until a few years later, which should have made my carrier very different.\n\nBy the way, COM taught me this thing called interface based programming too. COM interfaces have functions but not data. COM is not OO - you start by writing an interface definition by this language called IDL. Doesn’t it sound familiar?\n\n"},{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/darvish","date":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 15:04:00 GMT","title":"他人の理想のために生きてないわ。自分が生きたいように生きるし、言いたいことを言う！ - Darvish Yu","epoch":"1408547040"},"markdownBody":"        \n\n\n[https://twitter.com/faridyu/status/502102389202370560](https://twitter.com/faridyu/status/502102389202370560)"},{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/matsumoto","date":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 21:47:25 GMT","title":"やりたいことは本当はすごく沢山あって   だけど大体の物は既にあるわけじゃないですか。\n既にある物に勝つためには\n優れたアイデアか   あと20年続けるモチベーション\nのどちらかが必要だと思います。","epoch":"1408052845"},"markdownBody":"        \n\n\nまつもとゆきひろさん\n\n（ Rebuild.fm EP53 [http://rebuild.fm/53/](http://rebuild.fm/53/) )"},{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/on-startups-how-we-develop-new-features-extremely","date":"Thu, 05 Jun 2014 03:26:11 GMT","title":"On Startups: How we develop new features extremely fast","epoch":"1401938771"},"markdownBody":"        \n[eventjoy](http://blog.eventjoy.com/post/87807448121/on-startups-how-we-develop-new-features-extremely-fast):\n\n> It’s no secret that we’re a small team, two people to be exact.

But this id\\_token thing is new for me. I got used to using Facebook’s signed\\_request, but only as a client or a relying party. Now when it comes to becoming a server, it seems you must implement this mechanism by yourself.\n\nComponents that construct id\\_token are freely available out there - JSON WebToken, Base64, and HMAC signatures. But the real problem is that you have to manage the cryptographic signature that you rely on very carefully. For example, Google rotates its public key every day (and it says it’s cacheable! is it really?). If it is one of reference implementations, I have to implement it in a similar way too. Sigh.\n\nThis alone makes me believ the points made in my previous entry stronger - this is really only for big guys. If you can’t do this, you can’t afford storing people’s passwords in your system.\n\nI personally have no problem asking Google and Facebook to behave as my identity provider for all websites that require my information to do some awesome stuff. But I also know, as one of those online service providers, that people do hate logging in via a third party token; they prefer give us their email addresses and passwords. It’s likely due to experiences that hurt these people when they gave a service their Facebook access\\_token; a service may have posted something embarrassing on behalf of them, for example.\n\nThose who had hard time in that way may have learned that giving garbage email address and using 1password is the safest way because most service providers like us are potentially evil. All of us.\n\nI wonder how OpenID Connect crosses this hurdle - becoming a server is hard and that may be fine, but it is a big problem if using it as a client (RP) may not help a service grow its user base because of the very issue OpenID Foundation is trying to tackle - our passwords may have to be stored in these many places because that is what users want us to do.\n\n"},{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/is-openid-connect-a-new-version-of-openid","date":"Sun, 09 Mar 2014 19:34:00 GMT","title":"Is OpenID Connect a new version of OpenID?","epoch":"1394393640"},"markdownBody":"        \nShort answer: who cares?\n\nTl;dr; no.\n\nOpenID Connect seems getting traction. As one of implementers of an OpenID and OpenID 2.0 implementations, I am very curious about why the foundation keeps using the term OpenID with it.\n\nOpenID, to me, was a revolution started by a few brightest minds of our generation. Its aim was to be “a decentralized identity system, but one that’s actually decentralized and doesn’t entirely crumble if one company turns evil or goes out of business.” ([The top page of OpenID.net in 2005)](http://web.archive.org/web/20050924033518/http://www.danga.com/openid/).\n\nIs OpenID Connect still a decentralized identity system that doesn’t crumble if Facebook or Google or AOL or whichever internet giant goes out of business? No, it is not something like that. But who cares? If they go, everybody goes.\n\nIt has been that way OpenID evolved since OpenID 2.0, which allows you to start an authentication process by merely stating you are one of an account holders of “yahoo.com”. OpenID, because it is to verify that you own your own domain such as “www.lukypines.com”, always had to ask you to enter “http://www.luckypines.com”, or just for another example, “http://itsme.yahoo.com” (it is not a valid URI as of this writing). Neither Yahoo nor Google gives each user account its specific subdomain, like LiveJournal and TypePad did, like other hip services did too at that time. So that made insufficient for a person to be an account holder in Google, Yahoo, AOL, … to have him/herself to be an OpenID verified identity because s/he doesn’t own a domain.\n\nOpenID 2.0 solved the problem by adding OP Identifier to the spec. Instead of asking a user a domain s/he owns, it allowed a user to tell a relying party a domain owned by one of internet giants who should identify the user on behalf.\n\nAt this point, OpenID 2.0 becomes a protocol for a select few centralized identity providers, which only a few internet giants could manage your identity. It may be open because the protocol is open, and there are many reference implementations that are open source. but OpenID 2.0 is not “a decentralized identification system” any more.\n\nIt was interesting that OpenID was “a visionary’s tool that never got much commercial adoption” for the OpenID foundation, and OpenID 2.0 had adoption problems because it relies on XML (“[What is the history of OpenID?” - http://openid.net/connect/faq/](http://openid.net/connect/faq/)).\n\nThose are probably true; as one of Six Apart employees (2006 - 2010), I saw OpenID implementations everywhere; but those are all by visionaries and none was by those giants. It was a start-up project. I saw a lot of implementations of many many things that relied on XML. But those were not by someones who should be considered majority enough.\n\nNow, finally, OpenID Connect launches. It’s not even an OpenID 3.0. It’s just a profile of OAuth 2.0. I am confused; why shouldn’t it be OAuth 2.0 + Authentication Profile? I mean, those concerns that OpenID Foundation raises are valid; relying too much on HTTP redirection don’t work well in this native mobile app eco-system. XML is a thing in the past; JSON is the only pragmatic option of serializing an opaque data between two computer systems and communicate them over the wire. But it doesn’t solve the problem in a way the visionaries saw in OpenID. Why does it have to be a version of OpenID?\n\nI may be feeling a little too nostalgic; it was good old days for me when everything around me looked brighter. I am not saying OpenID Connect or OpenID Foundation is a BS. As a matter of fact I’ll implement it to our own service soon. But I can’t help but feeling uncomfortable when someone says it is the “Identity Layer of the Internet”, when all it does is to encourage us to rely on very small number of giants and forget about my owning my own identity. OpenID encouraged me to be free from authority; OpenID Connect encourages me to rely on it.\n\nYes, I’m interested in [Camilstore](https://camlistore.org/) too although I haven’t done anything with it yet.\n\n"},{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/my-first-public-presentation-in-english","date":"Thu, 06 Mar 2014 04:12:10 GMT","title":"My first public presentation in English","epoch":"1394079130"},"markdownBody":"        \nDue to our CEO’s absence, I took the stage of one of the greatest meetup around the world, New York Tech Meetup last night, to introduce ColorSync.

I learned how to program by learning Structured Programming. Yes, that “avoid goto, everything you write you can write in a sequence, loop or conditional blocks”. Yeah I am old. What are you looking at?\n\nTo me jQuery selector is a GOTO in BASIC (and any other languages). It’s actually a feature that only advanced programmers can use it correctly for a few correct reasons. Yet similar to GOTO in BASIC, it is always those someones who are not real programmers who don’t have solid understanding of whatever programming paradigm who tend to use jQuery.

But it’s time for me to move on to more structured way of writing frontend code.\n\nEnter AngularJS. Until last week I only took a few glances of its tutorial, and read a few articles about it. It sounded like you would be able to separate your HTML completely from someone else’s jQuery. It sounded nice.\n\nI started writing my first AngularJS controller.

I only had to move the code that was written with Underscore and jQuery to AngularJS.\n\nIt turned out it was actually mere three days job to fully migrate the page to be based on AngularJS. Part of the reason is that the page was already well separated into logic and view thanks to my colleague. I saw a few holes in here and there while I was working on that page, which I will explain in the following entry.\n\nSo far I like how I write AngularJS controller and a few helper modules, and tests.

That’s good. But its document was a little bit confusing to me. This is how I ended up implementing Perl code that populates Instagram pictures that have a hashtag of my interest.\n\nFirst confusion - is authentication required or not?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nTo get information of pictures with a hashtag, Instagram API offers “Tag” endpoints. [The document about Tag endpoint](http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/tags/)s says though it requires authentication, thus requires access\\_token parameter. But wait, whose access\\_token does it require, when all I want is information about publicly viewable photos with a hashtag?\n\nI thought it didn’t make sense to give my own access\\_token that does work on behalf of my own user account. Or any user account. My intention was to implement a backend service that works periodically to collect pictures with certain hashtags. I just ignored the document and just gave my app’s client\\_id that I generated on Instagram console. As expected, it worked.\n\n### Point #1: you probably don’t need access\\_token and all of those pita steps to get OAuth2 access token from a user account.\n\nSecond confusion: how do I paginate the results to get more results?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTwitter API does a great job by offering since\\_id and max\\_id parameters, so we as a client developer doesn’t have to consider duplicated tweets from two result sets from API calls. [Twitter documentation about “Working with Timelines”](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/working-with-timelines) is really well written and easy to understand what we should do.\n\nSince Instagram offers same type of data that is a stream of posts ordered by pictures posted descending, it has similar pagination parameters; it is only more confusing.\n\nInstagram API names those paramters as max\\_tag\\_id and min\\_tag\\_id. [Instagram API also returns “pagination” meta data](http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/#pagination) in API results, which has “next\\_url” value which looks something like this\n\n[https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/puppy/media/recent?client\\_id=xxx&max\\_tag\\_id=1391400658711](https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/puppy/media/recent?client_id=xxx&max_tag_id=1391400658711)\n\nIt also carries two more important values\n\n{  \n\"next\\_max\\_tag\\_id\":\"1391400658711\",  \n\"min\\_tag\\_id\":\"1391400689156\"  \n}\n\nCalling the API by using the next\\_url value (note that it has the same id as next\\_max\\_tag\\_id has) returns the next set of results which carries the newest pictures whose id is less than max\\_tag\\_id.\n\nAs my goal is to get pictures periodically, storing next\\_max\\_tag\\_id for the next iteration doesn’t make sense because specifying that value narrows down the results to something that I always have collected.\n\nSo, I rather stored min\\_tag\\_id and called the API next time with something like \n\n[https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/puppy/media/recent?client\\_id=xxx&min\\_tag\\_id=1391400658711](https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/puppy/media/recent?client_id=xxx&min_tag_id=1391400658711)\n\nUnfortunately, this returned nothing. It was obvious after a few more experiments and scratching my head, that because what I wanted was pictures posted after the biggest id, but Instagram calls it “min\\_tag\\_id”! Instagram calls it small ids as “max”, or “next” when in fact it is actually about getting older data, instead of new data that I assumed.\n\nSo the final code of mine stores the “min\\_tag\\_id” in the database for the next iteration, and calls the API with min\\_tag\\_id=<stored min\\_tag\\_id>, to avoid getting data that is already in our database.\n\n### Point #2: “max” and “next” could mean different things to different heads.\n\nIn my humble opinion though, Twitter API does smarter job here as it called those parameters as since\\_id and max\\_id, less confusing at least to me.\n\n"},{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/migrating-google-login-from-openid-20-to-google","date":"Sun, 26 Jan 2014 16:30:00 GMT","title":"Migrating Google login from OpenID 2.0 to Google+ (Part 1 of 3)","epoch":"1390753800"},"markdownBody":"        \nWe’ve been allowing users to use their Google accounts to login to Peatix.

IIRC, OAuth2 based login protocol was still in beta or something that it could change later. At that time around September 2011, people still believed that OAuth2 would obsolete OAuth 1.0a. Well, OAuth2 could change, OAuth1 has no future, I’d had to say OpenID was the best choice. And I implemented it.\n\nFast forward two years, It’s got obvious that\n\n*   [OAuth2 is a dead end](http://hueniverse.com/2012/07/on-leaving-oauth/). At least as an “authentication protocol”.\n*   OpenID lives and lives well, although “techy”(cough cough) people tends to see OpenID dead.\n*   OAuth 1.0a lives in a good shape - Twitter won the bet.\n\nIn other words, in a discussion of “which authentication protocol should I use in 2014?”, OpenID is still not a bad choice.\n\nWhen it comes to Google login however, there is a different story. “Google+” login that Google is encouraging to implement is based on OAuth2 protocol. And it gives you many benefits over OpenID - seamless login between Android and web for example. By 2014, it became natural for me to want to migrate our OpenID based authentication to Google+.\n\nI started research around that idea around June 2013 (that was when I filed a story in our Pivotal Tracker project). There were two simple requirements:\n\n*   Users can login via Google+ / OAuth2 protocol\n*   Existing users with Google OpenID associated to their accounts can still login to land to the same Peatix account without too much hassle\n\nThe second part was tough though, because we only keep [$verified\\_identity->url](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::OpenID::VerifiedIdentity#vident-url) in our storage which looks like this\n\n[https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawkFEXN4pg8u52IM\\_YLN86LIolXUxqKrU3M](https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawkFEXN4pg8u52IM_YLN86LIolXUxqKrU3M)\n\nAnd it didn’t seem like Google would give us both Google+ ID and OpenID for an account so Peatix could match two to migrate the user to Google+ in a seamless manner.\n\nIt didn’t seem like so, until December 2013.\n\nTo be continued to [Part 2 of this story about migrating Google OpenID to Google+](http://fumiakiy.tumblr.com/post/74620761400/).\n\n"},{"frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/reloaded","date":"Sun, 26 Jan 2014 15:55:29 GMT","title":"Reloaded","epoch":"1390751729"},"markdownBody":"        \nIt’s been a while since I posted the last entry to my blog.
