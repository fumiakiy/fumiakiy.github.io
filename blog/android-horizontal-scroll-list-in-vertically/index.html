Basically, many RecyclerViews are nested inside a RecyclerView. Each child RecyclerView has as many items its adapter gives it, and <a href="https://github.com/fumiakiy/HorizontalScrollSample/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/luckypines/horizontalscrollsample/HorizontalItemsViewHolder.java#L22">renders each item using (happens to be) the same layout as is used in the parent RecyclerView to render a simple text</a>.

ViewHolder should be a reusable utility class for a type of View/Layout rendered in a RecyclerView. It must not be tied to a particular item. But in order to implement OnItemClickListener, an instance of ViewHolder must know about either the list of items that its parent RecyclerView is rendering, or each item that is rendered. The latter makes the ViewHolder un-reusable.
