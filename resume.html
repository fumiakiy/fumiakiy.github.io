    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <div class="work">
      <h3>Senior Software Engineer, Incubator division, I&CO (formerly Inamoto & Co.), October 2019 -</h3>
      <h3>Android Engineer, Incubator division, I&CO (formerly Inamoto & Co.), August 2017 - September 2019</h3>
      <p>
        I wear many hats in this job. I do all kinds of works related to software engineering including multiple Android
        and iOS apps, websites using React, and macOS applications/frameworks using Objective-C and Swift.
      </p>
      <h3>Examples of the projects</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mado">Mado</a></dt>
        <dd>A 1:1 video chat app focusing on grandparents to grandchildren communication</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.inamoto.tinyglo.android">TinyGlo</a></dt>
        <dd>Subtle but fun night light app that uses the phones' screen as an ambient light</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://tinylog.iandco.com/">Tiny Log</a></dt>
        <dd>Send texts (SMS) to Tiny Log and it understands what your baby is doing at the moment, and log them so you can see the timeline later on the web or as a SMS message.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://keygaroo.iandco.com/">Keygaroo</a></dt>
        <dd>A Sketch plugin written in Objective-C that helps you learn the shortcut keys by detecting what you do in Sketch and let you know the equivalent shortcut key combination of the task.</dd>
      </dl>
      <h3>Other notable projects</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Family Calendar</dt>
        <dd>A system backed by a suite of a React based website, Google Apps Script to automate Gmail inbox, Firebase Functions, Firebase Cloud Firestore and Firebase Authentication, that allows users to forward any emails related to a family's schedule to automatically generate a shared calendar view for the events by parsing the contents of the emails.</dd>
        <dt>OAuth2 endpoints backed by Firebase Authentication</dt>
        <dd>The Family Calendar adds an endpoint by that users can post texts that may contain information about events via IFTTT. In order to authenticate the requests the backend needed to implement OAuth2 authrization but Firebase Authentication is not compatible with OAuth2. I wrote a simple wrapper of it so that it behaves as an OAuth2 endpoint so that IFTTT can send authorized requests to the service.</dd>
        <dt>Font Animator App</dt>
        <dd>Take any fonts and type in some texts, and the Android and the iOS apps make the text animate like a person is writing it. The apps can save the animation in GIF, SVG or in MP4.</dd>
      </dl>
      <h3>Teck Talk presentations</h3>
      <p>As a resident tech person, I gave presentations to the colleagues in Tech Talk sessions. The titles include:</p>

      <h3>Senior Software Engineer, Peatix Inc, April 2011 - August 2017</h3>
      <h3>Senior Software Engineer, Orinoco KK, July 2010 - August 2017</h3>
      <p>Though not in my title, I was <em>the</em> technical founding member of Peatix. Since I started to write the
        first line of code for the service, I architect its system design including on which server in a network to put
        a
        particular component, and object oriented design of each component, and coding style of each line of code. I was
        also a primary software engineer of its iOS app _and_ two Android apps. I was the devops of the service; on-call
        24/7 fix bugs and respond to escalation call from customer support center. Orinoco KK became Peatix Inc.</p>

      <p>Since the company decided to offer Peatix at around December 2010, a premier online event management and
        ticketing service, I have single-handedly architected, designed and wrote code from the scratch for the service,
        ground up based on Perl/Catalyst, MySQL, Memcached. Since the launch of the service, it expands its reach beyond
        Japan to Asia (Singapore, Malaysia, Australia...) and Europe, and the US, hosted more than 250,000 events,
        attended by more than 2,000,000 users.</p>

      <p>Our two Android apps (one for event attendees and the other for event organizers) were completely written
        solely
        by me. The first version was built and shipped during pre-GingerBread era, but I used my spare time and weekend
        to
        rebuild it to then-new Material Design based and shipped it in 2 months.</p>

      <p>I have written more than 80% of its codebase since launch for 7 years, including but not limited to fairly new
        parts such as the search page which consist of AngularJS backed frontend and Twiggy backed non-blocking web
        technology (HTML5 SSE). I was also one of the three software engineers who write code for our iOS apps. I have
        also been mostly if not the only person who works as an operations engineer for the service, playing as a one
        stop
        technical contact for the other team members such as sales, marketing and customer support.
