    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>Senior Software Engineer, Incubator division, I&CO (formerly Inamoto & Co.), October 2019 -</h3>
    <h3>Android Engineer, Incubator division, I&CO (formerly Inamoto & Co.), August 2017 - September 2019</h3>
    <p>
      I wear many hats in this job. I do all kinds of works related to software engineering including multiple Android
      and iOS apps, websites using React, and macOS applications/frameworks using Objective-C and Swift.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a member of the incubator division of the company, I contribute the team with ideas that may or may not become
      a MVP product. I write MVP proposal documentation, along with building a proof of concept software product, so the
      team can better see what the idea could appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest project involves Google Apps Script to automate Gmail inbox, to call Firebase Functions to store some
      data in Firebase Cloud Firestore. The system also has a website where users can sign up or sign in, whose backend
      was built with Firebase Authentication, written in React.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also wrote an OAuth2 wrapper around Firebase Authentication as Firebase Functions endpoints, so users can set up
      the system and make their own IFTTT recipe. I built a few IFTTT API endpoints too. All written in TypeScript with
      unit tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an Android engineer, I wrote two apps that is built with MVP pattern, using RxJava, Retrofit, Dagger2, and
      other modern libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest Android app I wrote was written from scratch in Kotlin with serialization and coroutines, that
      generates MP4 movie, animated GIF and SVG from what are rendered on the screen of a device.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an iOS engineer, I am writing from scratch an app that is built with MVVM/Coordinator using RxSwift, Alamofire
      and hand-made dependency injection mechanism to make them easier to write tests. All scratch in Swift.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest iOS app I wrote was written from scratch in Swift 4.2, that generates MP4 movie and animated GIF from
      what are rendered on the screen of a device.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also wrote a simple SPA website for one of those apps I built above using React.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also wrote a Sketch plugin using Objective-C and accessibility API of macOS.
    </p>
    <h3>Senior Software Engineer, Peatix Inc, April 2011 - August 2017</h3>
    <h3>Senior Software Engineer, Orinoco KK, July 2010 - August 2017</h3>
    <p>Though not in my title, I was <em>the</em> technical founding member of Peatix. Since I started to write the
      first line of code for the service, I architect its system design including on which server in a network to put a
      particular component, and object oriented design of each component, and coding style of each line of code. I was
      also a primary software engineer of its iOS app _and_ two Android apps. I was the devops of the service; on-call
      24/7 fix bugs and respond to escalation call from customer support center. Orinoco KK became Peatix Inc.</p>

    <p>Since the company decided to offer Peatix at around December 2010, a premier online event management and
      ticketing service, I have single-handedly architected, designed and wrote code from the scratch for the service,
      ground up based on Perl/Catalyst, MySQL, Memcached. Since the launch of the service, it expands its reach beyond
      Japan to Asia (Singapore, Malaysia, Australia...) and Europe, and the US, hosted more than 250,000 events,
      attended by more than 2,000,000 users.</p>

    <p>Our two Android apps (one for event attendees and the other for event organizers) were completely written solely
      by me. The first version was built and shipped during pre-GingerBread era, but I used my spare time and weekend to
      rebuild it to then-new Material Design based and shipped it in 2 months.</p>

    <p>I have written more than 80% of its codebase since launch for 7 years, including but not limited to fairly new
      parts such as the search page which consist of AngularJS backed frontend and Twiggy backed non-blocking web
      technology (HTML5 SSE). I was also one of the three software engineers who write code for our iOS apps. I have
      also been mostly if not the only person who works as an operations engineer for the service, playing as a one stop
      technical contact for the other team members such as sales, marketing and customer support.
